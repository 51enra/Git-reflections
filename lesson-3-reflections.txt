When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
 - Having a cloud backup
 - Being able to access the repository from different locations with different computers
 - Sharing the repository with other interested users
 - Working collaboratively on the repository
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 If different people are working in the remote repository, I may not want to have all changes or I want them at
 a later time.
